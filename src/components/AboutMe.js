                        <p>Hey everyone, I'm Adrian! I'm a marketing/PR pro turned full-stack web developer, having recently completed an intensive four-month bootcamp at Xccelerate last year and now in my first job as a full-time developer with PLAY Production. I got passionate about coding fairly quickly, and 
                        what continues to excites me most about coding is the ability to craft something novel each day.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Before my training with Xccelerate, I specialised in content development, digital marketing, public relations
                        and social media management. I've recently moved back to Hong Kong after spending the past 9 years working and studying in the UK.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Having achieved a Bachelors degree in Journalism and Masters in Marketing, Communications
                        and Advertising, I have accumulated over six years of experience in developing content, both online and offline,
                        and managing social media throughout my tenure as editor and writer of MadbuzzHK, a Hong Kong-based online
                        entertainment magazine that I co-founded with two friends, a marketing executive for
                        Blockchain-VR start-up ImmVRse and most recently as an account executive for London-based PR agency Elate
                        Communications
